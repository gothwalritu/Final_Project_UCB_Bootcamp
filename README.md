# Final_Project_UCB_Bootcamp

## Introduction

We all love recreation activities in and around water. We always wonder where we should go, and which locations have the safest water for
recreational activities, as well as which locations have potable water.

In this project we will develop a tool which will show locations around Lake Sammamish in Washington State, and display which are safe for
recreational and potability use. It will be an interactive tool which takes user input for geolocation and recommends the locations which 
are fit for potability and recreational uses. The location will be displayed using marker layer map and pop-up markers, information about 
weather and water quality.

## ML model you are thinking of using and why it would be good for your case

The team is experimenting with linear regression and logistic regression. We believe either would be good because the data we are working with
can be either continuous or categorical.

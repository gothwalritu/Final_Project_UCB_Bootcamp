# Final_Project_UCB_Bootcamp

## Introduction

We all love recreation activities in and around water. We always wonder where we should go, and which locations have the safest water for
recreational activities, as well as which locations have potable water.

In this project we will develop a tool which will show locations around Lake Sammamish in Washington State, and display which are safe for
recreational and potability use. It will be an interactive tool which takes user input for geolocation and recommends the locations which 
are fit for potability and recreational uses. The location will be displayed using marker layer map and pop-up markers, information about 
weather and water quality.

## ERD

We used Quick DBD to create a ERD of our data

## ML models under consideration

The team is experimenting with linear regression, logistic regression, and neural network modeling. We believe these would be good because the data 
we are working with can be either continuous or categorical.

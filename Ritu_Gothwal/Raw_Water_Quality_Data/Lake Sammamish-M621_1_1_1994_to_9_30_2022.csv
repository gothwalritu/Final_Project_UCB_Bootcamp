Water samples are reported as mg/L of water, while sediment samples are reported as mg/kg of 
                    sediment (wet weight). Results of bacteria cultures are reported as CFU (colony-forming units)/100mls
                     of liquid sample or as MPN (most probable number)/g of thick or solid samples.
Note: ORG/100 ml = CFU/100 ml
These data include samples collected during both baseflow and wet weather/storm flow events.
Chlorophyll a - The laboratory changed analysis methods in July 1996. This method change resulted 
                    in a 14 percent increase in chlorophyll values due to improved extraction. Values reported prior to 
                    July 1996 can be adjusted by increasing them 14 percent for comparison with more recent data.
Total Phosphorus Note: The KCEL changed the TP analysis method in July 1998 and again in Jan 2007.
                    These changes resulted in a bias towards lower TP values reported. For comparisons with historical 
                    data, values reported after July 1, 1998 may be multiplied by a factor of 1.262. (R2 = 0.989)
